    "- Given orthogonal complements of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and a vector $V$, there is a unique decomposition of $V$. (Decomposition Theorem?)  This is really a theoretical statement that could come after LSS.  Perhaps we could add a section after LSS addressing projections in the abstract.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If $AX=B$ is inconsistent, we understand that $B$ is not in $\\mathcal{C}(A)$.  We could propose to solve $AX=\\hat{B}$, where $\\hat{B}$ is the projection of $B$ onto $\\mathcal{C}(A)$, but this requires that we explain that $\\hat{B}$ is the closest vector to $B$ that is in $\\mathcal{C}(A)$.  (Best Approximation Theorem?)  This approach does not provide any motivation, and further requires that we discuss projection onto subspaces, which should not be the emphasis of the section.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We could propose that if there is no $X$ for which $AX=B$, we could seek the vector $\\hat{X}$ that minimizes the error $E = A\\hat{X}-B$.  This could be solved with Calculus, or we could reason that $E$ is minimum when $\\hat{X}$ is the solution to $AX=\\hat{B}$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- It turns out that the error is at its minimum exactly when it is orthogonal to $\\mathcal{C}(A)$ (Again, we need the Best Approximation result.)  We could thus require that $E$ is orthogonal to each column of $A$, or equivalently, that $E$ lie in $\\mathcal{N}(A)$.  This leads directly to the normal equations $A^TA=A^TB$. "
