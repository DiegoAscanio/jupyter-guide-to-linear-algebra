Vector Spaces
=======================

This Chapter looks at several ideas concerning vector space.  Although it is possible to think about a vector space in a very abstract way, we will focus on just two or three concrete examples.


Objectives:

1. Determine when a linear system has a solution.
2. Determine when the solution to a linear system is unique.
3. Identify vector subspaces.
4. Determine if a given vector lies in a given subspace.

Sections:

1. Linear combinations and spans and connection to linear systems
2. AX = B for non-square A.  Inconsistent systems and solutions to homogenous systems.
3. General vector spaces and subspaces.
4. Nullspace and Column space.
