If we link all of these ideas together we will be able to gain information about the solution of the system $AX=B$, based on some information about linear independence.\n",

This vector equation represents a homogenous linear system that could also be described as $AX=0$, where $V_1$, $V_2$, ... $V_n$ are the columns of the matrix $A$, and $X$ is the vector of unknown coefficients.  The set of vectors is linearly independent if and only if the associated homogeneous system has a solution other than the vector with all entries equal to zero.  The vector of all zeros is called the **trivial solution**.  This zero vector is called a trivial solution because it is a solution to *every homogeneous system* $AX=0$, regardless of the entries of $A$.  For this reason, we are interested only in the existence of *nontrivial solutions* to $AX=0$.\n",

Let us also suppose that a related nonhomogeneous $AX=B$ also has some particular solution, which we could label $X_p$.  So we have $AX_h = 0$ and $AX_p = B$.  Now by the properties of matrix multiplication, $X_p + X_h$ is also a solution to $AX=B$ since $A(X_p + X_h) = AX_p + AX_h = B + 0$.  "
