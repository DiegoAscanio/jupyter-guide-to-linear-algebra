    "### Cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the primary goals of cryptography is to secure communications by encoding messages.  The encoded message is difficult to read by anyone except for the intended recipient, who posseses some secret knowledge that allows them to reverse the process and decode the message.  The original message is known as _plaintext_, and the encoded message is known as _ciphertext_.  We demonstrate here the well-known Hill Ciper, which is a method of transforming plaintext to ciphertext using familiar matrix multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Encryption\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that the plaintext and ciphertext will be made up of characters from the same predefined _alphabet_.  This alphabet can contain letters, numbers, punctuation, and any number of other symbols that might be appropriate.  We also need a square invertible matrix $B$, called the encryption matrix.  Given these parameters, we take the following steps to get from plaintext to ciphertext.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Translate the plaintext from alphabet charaters into a list of numbers.\n",
    "2. Divide the list of numbers into a collection of $N\\times 1$ vectors.  Use these numbers as columns in a plaintext array $P$.\n",
    "3. Apply the cipher by multiplying each vector by the matrix $B$.  This produces a ciphertext array $C=BP$.\n",
    "4. Translate the columns of $C$ back into a string of alphabet characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get started, we first need a way to exchange a message that includes letters, numbers, and possibly other characters, into to a message that consists of only numbers.  The easiest thing to do is to substitute each possible character in the message for a number.  For example we might let A=1, B=2, C=3, and so on.  In order to make this process less obvious, we might scramble the order of the numbers (A=23, B=5, C=12, ...), or substitute single numbers for common groups of letters (TH=32, EE=20, ING=17, ...).  However we choose to convert our message from text to numbers, there will still be patterns that remain among the numbers due to the natural patterns of the underlying language.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this demonstration, we will make use of a list named $\\texttt{alphabet}$ to convert between letters and numbers.  This list is included in the $\\texttt{hillcipher}$ module, which contains some other functions that we will need.  If we print the list, we can see that it contains a space, a period, a question mark, and all uppercase letters.   "
