    "### Cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the primary goals of cryptography is to secure communications by encoding messages.  The encoded message is difficult to read by anyone except for the intended recipient, who posseses some secret knowledge that allows them to reverse the process and decode the message.  The original message is known as _plaintext_, and the encoded message is known as _ciphertext_.  We demonstrate here a well-known and straightforward method of transforming plaintext to ciphertext using matrix multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get started, we first need a way to exchange a message that includes letters, numbers, and possibly other characters, into to a message that consists of only numbers.  The easiest thing to do is to substitute each possible character in the message for a number.  For example we might let A=1, B=2, C=3, and so on.  In order to make this process less obvious, we might scramble the order of the numbers (A=23, B=5, C=12, ...), or substitute single numbers for common groups of letters (TH=32, EE=20, ING=17, ...).  However we choose to convert our message from text to numbers, there will still be patterns that remain among the numbers due to the natural patterns of the underlying language.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this demonstration, we will use a standard known as ASCII to make our substitutions.  This standard is already supported in a Python library, and does not require us to type in all of our substitutions.  The only new commands we need are $\\texttt{ord}$, which accepts a single character and returns a number, and $\\texttt{chr}$, which does the opposite.  Give it a try in the following cell.  "
