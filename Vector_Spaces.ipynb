These operations should produce other vectors in the collection and they should satisfy a list of algebraic requirements such as associativity, commutativity, etc.  Although we will not consider the implications of each requirement here, we provide the list here for reference.\n",

The required definitions of addition and scalar multiplication in $R^n$ are those described for matrices in [Matrix Algebra](Matrix_Algebra.ipynb).
