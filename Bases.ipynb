    "When working with vector spaces, or subspaces, it is often useful to express arbitrary vectors as linear combinations of a set of given vectors known as a basis.  A **basis** for a vector space (or subspace) is a collection of linearly indpendent vectors that span the space.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a basis $\\{V_1, V_2, V_3, ... V_n\\}$ for the vector space $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the definition implies that any vector $Y$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors.  That means that the vector equation $c_1V_1 + c_2V_2 + ... c_nV_n = Y$ has a unique solution.  This statement is a result of our earlier conclusions about systems of equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $A$ be the $n\\times 1$ matrix with the basis vectors $V_1$, $V_2$, ... $V_n$ as its columns, and $X$ the vector of weights $c_1$, $c_2$, ... $c_n$.  In order to express $Y$ as a linear combination of the basis vectors, we need to solve the linear system $AX = Y$.  Since the basis vectors span $\\mathbb{R}^n$ we know that the system is consistent for any $Y$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$.  This implies that $A$ must have a pivot in every row.  The fact that the basis vectors are linearly independent implies that the system must have a unique solution.  This means there can be no free variables in ths system, which means that there must be a pivot in each column.  The RREF of an $n\\times n$ matrix with a pivot in every row and column is the $n\\times n$ identity matrix.   "

    "In order to discuss the concept of coordinates, it is useful to label the bases that under discussion.  We will opt to use greek letters for these labels in order to keep the notation for bases distinct.  Suppose then we are given a basis $\\beta = \\{V_1, V_2, V_3, ... V_n\\}$ and a vector $X=c_1V_1 + c_2V_2 + ... c_nV_n$.  The weights $c_1$, $c_2$, ... $c_n$ are called the **coordinates** of X with respect to the basis $\\beta$.  It is only natural to collect these weights into an array.  Despite potential confusion, this array is referred to as the coordinate vector."
